Officially, OpenCV releases two types of Python interfaces, cv and cv2.

cv:

In this, all OpenCV data types are preserved as such. For example, when loaded, images are of format cvMat, same as in C++.

cv2:

And the latest one is cv2. In this, everything is returned as NumPy objects like ndarray and native Python objects like lists,tuples,dictionary, etc. So due to this NumPy support, you can do any numpy operation here. NumPy is a highly stable and fast array processing library.

In short, with cv2 everything is simplified and pretty fast.
